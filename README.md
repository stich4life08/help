Literally a 1.18.12 CPVP client for Geyser HvH servers.

Basically, this client's source was leaked quite a while back by good old Vibie.
So, I don't really see a point in keeping this private anymore.

Anyway, I no longer have the time to actually continue this client myself, due to personal reasons

Also, you are free to take anything from this, however, please credit the us if the thing you are taking does not exist in Horion or any of the other leaked Horion sources.
